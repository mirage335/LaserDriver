#HardStart
On connection to 12V power, current surges, on the order of >3.5A/5us, but less than 12A, have been known to occur and destroy expensive laser diodes. Lockout board is intended to prevent this, by disconnecting and forcing the control signal to ground.

#Blanks
Buying some low-cost diodes for testing purposes can be useful if the stability of the driver power supply is uncertain.
