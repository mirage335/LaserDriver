#HardStart
Lockout board is available to minimize power-glitch related current surges. Generally, it should not be necessary unless other problems (ie. ground loops) are destroying laser diodes.

#Blanks
Buying some low-cost diodes for testing purposes can be useful if the stability of the driver power supply is uncertain.
