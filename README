#Usage
Variable power laser driver, usable with diodes like NBD7878 and BDR-209, on machines like the Taz_Mega and LulzBot Taz. Takes <24V ~30kHz PWM control signal, 12V power, and drives laser at 2W-3W maximum optical power.

#Design
Basic voltage controlled current source. Common collector transistor amplifier attempts to maintain given voltage across emitter resistor. Consequently, the collector load (ie. laser) is allowed to source just enough current to maintain that voltage.

Low-value collector load is placed behind a safety switch. Optical output with this switch open is expected to be <<100mW, likely <2mW.

#Pulse Mode
Bypasses are provided to disable the low-pass filter and enable 30A current. Intended for experimental use with PWM signals to produce crude 10us laser pulses.

#Future Work
*) Programmable pulse-mode laser driver using similar pinout.
*) Beam stearing optoelectronics, for VLSI photolithographic exposure.

#Safety
Big scary laser. Do not examine with remaining eye. Seriously.

High-power, Class 4 near-UV lasers, such as BDR-209 and NDB7875 are extraordinarily hazardous. Backscatter from the projected spot alone is sufficient to slice a retina. Avoid exposure, and wear eye protection.

Beware common grounding and other issues may falsely trigger the control transistor. In general, the laser system should be consiered dangerous whenever powered, particularly when the "SAFETY" switch is closed.

No claim of liability is made by anyone. Your accident is your accident. Use common sense, and follow all regulations. If you don't understand the safety features and limitations, don't use this circuit or anything similar.
