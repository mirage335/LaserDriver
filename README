__Usage__
Variable power laser driver, specifically designed for NDB7875 diode. Takes 24V ~30kHz PWM control signal, 12V power, and drives laser at 2W-3W maximum optical power.

__Design__
Basic voltage controlled current source. Common collector transistor amplifier attempts to maintain given voltage across emitter resistor. Consequently, the collector load (ie. laser) is allowed to source just enough current to maintain that voltage.

Low-value collector load is placed behind a safety switch. Optical output with this switch open is expected to be <<100mW, likely <2mW.

__Safety__
Big scary laser. Do not examine with remaining eye. Seriously.

High-power, Class 4 near-UV lasers, such as NDB7875 are extraordinarily hazardous. Backscatter from the projected spot alone is sufficient to slice a retina. Avoid exposure, and wear eye protection.

No claim of liability is made by anyone. Your accident is your accident. Use common sense, and follow all regulations. If you don't understand the safety features and limitations, don't use this circuit or anything similar.
